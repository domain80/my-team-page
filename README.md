## Overview

## Where can I see your demo?

https://1jack80-myteampage.netlify.app

## What was My experience?

This project in particular got me combining grids with more advanced CSS
selectors. Also it was nice to get stuck on a problem once again and revisit the
Googling and peer to peer assistance that comes with being in this space.

## What I have learned/improved?

In this project, a few lessons on how to use writing modes were learnt.

### Built With

- [Reactjs with Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev)

This application/site was created as a submission to a
[DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The
[challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to
build an application to complete the given user stories.
